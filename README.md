# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
- Task Objectives
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions.
Given the significant class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions), the project emphasizes the importance of advanced sampling techniques, model selection, and performance evaluation.
