# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
 
## Task Objectives

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately detects fraudulent credit card transactions.
Given the significant class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent transactions), the project emphasizes the importance of advanced sampling techniques, model selection, and performance evaluation.
The project focuses on:
 -Handling highly imbalanced datasets.
 -Applying data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation techniques.
 -Improving model performance.

 ## Steps to Run the Project
